Description: Univariate splines in regression and smoothing models often adopt
    basis representation, which is neither intuitive to interpret, nor easy to
    post-process (like to solve an inverse problem where x-values such that the
    spline or an order of its derivative equals to a given value is backsolved).
    This package offers functions that transform regression splines to piecewise
    polynomials and piecewise polynomial methods for standard generic functions
    like summary(), plot(), predict() and solve(). Users can then easily export
    piecewise polynomial equations as formatted strings for pretty print, plot a
    spline or its derivatives (optionally with knots shown), predict a spline or
    its derivatives at new x-values, and solve an inverse problem. Extra tools
    for piecewise polynomials like adding two piecewise polynomials are provided
    as well. While the package focuses on regression splines, it also transforms
    interpolation splines and smoothing splines to piecewise polynomials, hence
    all methods and tools for piecewise polynomials are applicable.
